The group played a leading role in the 2013 -- 14 Thai political crisis , organising large-scale protests within Bangkok . The group was formed on 29 November 2013 by protest leader and former Democrat Party MP Suthep Thaugsuban , who appointed himself as secretary-general . The movement was supported by various organisations including the Democrat Party , the People 's Alliance for Democracy -LRB- a coalition of opposition to Thaksin -RRB- , student activist groups , state worker 's unions and pro-military groups . The PDRC 's support stemmed mostly from affluent Bangkokians and Southerners . Whistle-blowing was a central symbol of the protests . By accusing the government of lacking any legitimacy , Suthep Thaugsuban announced the intention of the People 's Democratic Reform Committee to take back sovereign power from the government and proceed with national reform through a non-elected royalist council , in order to `` eradicate '' the `` Thaksin regime '' . Suthep outlined plans for the council to `` act as a legislative body , amend laws and regulations , as well as carry out a reform plan in the country '' . He also explained the council would have 400 members , 300 of whom would be representatives from various professions . The remaining 100 would be selected by the PDRC from scholars and well-respected senior citizens . The ultimate goal of the PDRC was to have the prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra resign as the head of the caretaker government in order to allow a power vacuum then invoke article 3 `` The sovereign power belongs to the Thai people . The King as Head of State shall exercise such power through the National Assembly , the Council of Ministers and the Courts in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution . '' and article 7 `` Whenever no provision under this Constitution is applicable to any case , it shall be decided in accordance with the constitutional convention in the democratic regime of government with the King as Head of State . '' of the 2007 Constitution . This would have allowed the head of the senate to appoint a new premier . Yingluck and nine other senior ministers were removed from office by Constitutional Court on 7 May 2014 . The military then seized power in a coup d'état on 22 May , a move which was applauded by many PDRC protesters . The PDRC was disbanded shortly after the coup .
